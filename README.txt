What did I learn during this project? 
I guess I learned a bit about resolving issues with research when I find myself encountering a road block. 
This really helped cement a lot of the git work process. By the end of this project a lot of the muscle memory and process had really sunken in.

Going to dedicate some space in this README file to notes about CSS:
    CSS selectors
        Basically what this is about is selecting something or a type of something to modify throughout your document in a certain way
        There are many different ways to do this to achieve your specific end

        Element selectors

            p {
                color: lightblue;
                text-align;
            }
                // This will apply these modification to every p in the project. Good for standardizations across the entirety of a large project

        ID selectors
            #para1 {
                color: lightblue;
                text-align;
            }

            <p id="para1"> Hello World</p>

            // This one works almost like defining a variable. A definition is layed out above and it is called upon later with the id= operation. Important to note it can only be used on 1 thing

        Class selectors (all elements)
            // selects all elements with a certain Class
        Class selectors (for only p elements)

        The Universal selector
            * is used here instead of an element class or ID. it selects everything

        Grouping selectors
